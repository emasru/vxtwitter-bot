## vxtwitter-bot: A discord bot for fixing twitter (and instagram) links

Originally just created to fix Twitter links with the [vxtwitter](https://vxtwitter.com) service, but now also supports Instagram links with [InstaFix](https://www.ddinstagram.com/).

The bot itself is built using Pycord. I have not tested the bot with any permissions other than administrator, but it needs to see messages, and have the ability to delete other users messages as well as edit/delete its own.

# Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Put the token of your bot in `token.dat`

(If you have any suggestions for other emojis to represent the undo and delete button in the UI view, please send them to me: `emas#9462`)
