# vxtwitter-bot: A Discord bot for fixing Twitter (and other) links

Originally just created to fix Twitter links with the [vxtwitter](https://vxtwitter.com) service, but now also supports:

- Instagram links with [InstaFix](https://www.ddinstagram.com/)
- TikTok links with [vxtiktok](https://github.com/dylanpdx/vxtiktok) (hosted [here](https://vm.dstn.to/))

The bot itself is built using Pycord. I have not tested the bot with any permissions other than administrator, but it needs to see messages, and have the ability to delete other users messages as well as edit/delete its own.

## Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Put the token of your bot in `token.dat`

(If you have any suggestions or issues, please send them to me on Discord: `emas`)
